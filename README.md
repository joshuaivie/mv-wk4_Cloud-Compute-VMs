# Project: Ilera Search

> Ilera Search is a make-believe directory for nearby hospitals. It also allows users to register in hospitals and book hospital appointments beforehand. I was inspired by the UI designs for [Patashule](https://www.behance.net/gallery/25563385/PatashuleKE). My interpretation of the business requirements for my Microverse HTML and CSS module capstone project.
